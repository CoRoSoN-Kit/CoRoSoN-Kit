# Omniwheels

The provided STL files are for printing the omniwheels of the team TheRockys.

After you printed the parts, you still need some metal cubes with the size 5x5x5mm which have a threaded M3 hole through the center. If that's not good for the kit, then the design needs to be changed to accommodate some sort of nuts. As the small axels, you need a 1mm steal rod.
